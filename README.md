Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
-This is a form of engineering that uses modern principles, tools and methods to create high quality software
-software engineering is a systematic approach in designing, developing, maintaining and testing software. it involves applying engineering principlesto development a high quality software whereas traditional programming  refers to the writing of code to create a specific function or programmewithout following procedures or methodologies.
-Traditional programming involves writing of code without following procedures and methodologies whhereas s/engineering follows methodologies e.g. requirement gathering, design, implementation,teseing, maintenance.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): 
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
-These are steps by step phases taken when developing software. including Requirement gathering, design, analysis, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance. Each step is important to ensure budget and time constrains are met.
-requirement gathering: this is the process of gathering user requiirements and system requirement.
-design: This is the process of creating high quality software that meets user and system requirements.
-analysis: This is process of gauging whether the software has met the requirements.
-implementation: Process of writing code and building software according to the design.
-testing: This is conducting various tests to ensure that the software meets quality standardds and functional requirements.
-deployment: This is the release of toftware to users or customers.
-maintenance: This is improving the software to meet the current world requirements.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
-Agile methodology is an interactive and incremental approach in the development of software that involves collaboration, flexibility and response to change whereas waterfall model is a step by step approach in the development of software that involves use of distinct phases.
-Agile methodology is highly interractive and it has user involvement through all stages whereas waterfall model has minimal user involvement.
-Agile model is adaptive to change i.e. any phase in development can be reviewed and done in reflection to current real world evironment whereas Waterfall model is not adaptive and any phase completed during the development phase is not considered.

Requirements Engineering: 
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
-Requirements Engineering is a process of managingand documenting requirements throughout the entire software development life cycle. It involves managing changes to requirements as the project progresses.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
-modularity is a concept of software engineering where the software systems are divided into several modules or units that can be developed, tested and maintained independently.

how it improves maintainability:
-makes debugging and testing easy as a unit is tested as opposed to testing the whole system.
-reusability. the modules can be used in various areas of the project saving time.
-Interchangeability. Modules can easily be replaced with another when need arises without affecting the system.

how it improves scalability:
-incremental growth: new data can be added to the system without interfering with existing ones increasing the size of the system.
-resource allocation: the existing modules can be scaled up or down based on the demand of the module.
distributed development: modules can be worked upon independently by different servers or services

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
-Unit testing: this involves testing individual components to ensure that they work properly.
-Integration testing: This involves testing the software system to ensure that it works properly in the system in which it is within.
-system testing: This involves testing the entire software system to ensure it is free from defects and that it works properly.
-Acceptance testing: This involves testing the software system to ensure that it meets user requirements.

Testing is crucial as it helps to check whether the system is free from bugs and from breach vulnerabilities. It enables programmers to know whether the system has met user requirements.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
A version control system is a software tool used to manage changes to a sourse code. It enables easy collaboration between members enabling them to change the source code, view changes made and also enable reverting to the initial version. Examples include Git and Subversion.

Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. 
-A project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of softwre products.

What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Responsibilities:
-market research and analysis. They conduct market research to undersstand the market gaps, needs & trends. 
-defining the vision and strategy. they clearly describe the end goal of the project.
-requirement gathering. They ensure that this document is clear & complete. 
-documentation. They ensure that this document is clear & complete.
-quality assurance. they implement the right processes to be used to ensure a high quality software product is released.

challanges:
-fast technological changes. it is sometimes hard to track the rappidly changing technological advancement.
-ensuring quality and reliability. maintaining ethical requirements is a good thing but may cause a longer peiod of time for a high quality software to be produced.
-responding to user feedback. if the user feedback is bad, engineers will have to redo the entire process which is sometimes tiresome.
-market competition. negative competition has a negative impact to the sale of the final software product.
-change in management that as a result may impact project continuity.

Software Maintenance: 
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
software maintenance is process of updating, modifying and enhancing the existing software to meet the the evolving user requirements after deployment.
Types of software maintenance activities:
-corrective maintenance: this adresses bugs identified during testing restoring the software to its original state.
-adaptive maintenance: this involves maintaining the software to meet the current environment needs.
-perfective maintenance: this enhances the software to improve its performnce based on user feedback and b/s needs.
-preventive maintenance: this addresses potential issues or vulnerability in the software to prevent future problems.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
-Privacy concerns: This involves using personal data without proper consent.
-Software quality: This involves purposefully releasing low quality software or one with bugs that may harm users.
-security vulnerability: This involves releasing software that is prone to attack by malicious people. One that is not properly secure.
-conflict of interest: This involves prioritizing interests of clients and employers and ignoring safety concerns to meet goals and deadlines.

how to ensure ethical standards are met:
-collaboration: collaborating with colleagues and experts eable ethical issues to be raised.
-education and awareness: Through this manner, software engineers are able to be kept informed about the ethical needs in the world today. 
-transparency: clearly highlight the capabilities and limitations of the software systems and clearly highlight the rsks associated with them.
-user centric design: Prioritize user requirements when developing software systems reducing harm.
